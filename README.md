Here, I turn interesting Reddit posts into simple, hands-on projects. If I find something cool on Reddit that I've never tried before, I'll give it a shot and share my learnings here.


## Project: Cloud-Based Big Data Analysis with Python

### Introduction

Welcome to the Cloud-Based Big Data Analysis project! This project was inspired by a real-world scenario in which a large dataset (approximately 20GB) needed to be processed, wrangled, transformed, and analyzed using Python. 

### Problem Statement

The challenge here is to find a straightforward approach to host a large dataset in the cloud and perform data analysis using Python. The chosen solution involves using DuckDB as demonstrated in one of the answers to a related query. DuckDB offers a promising solution for handling and querying large datasets efficiently.
